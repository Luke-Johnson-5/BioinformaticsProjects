Part-1: On the experimental data
================================
Read the article given at https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24926665/ and answer the following
questions.
    a) How many genes were found to be differentially expressed?
    b) List the glucocorticoid-responsive genes that were identified.
    c) Which gene was found to have SNPs that were associated with inhaled corticosteroid resistance?


Part-2: Using STAR short read alignment program
========================================================
    The "star-align.sh" shell script performs the alignment of 
    reads from sample SRR1039508 to the partial genome indexed 
    in the previous step.

    Run the following command and check your output under the tmp 
    folder (/groups/bioc6243/data/tmp/). All files in this tmp 
    folder that start with your username are files by you.

    $ nohup sh star-align.sh &


Part-3: Parsing aligned reads for gene "MPV17" located in chr_2:27532360-27548547
=================================================================================
    The following commands:

    $ module load python3/3.9.0
    $ python3 sam-parser.py -i /groups/bioc6243/data/tmp/$username-aln-SRR1039508.Aligned.out.sam

    lists out splicing junction in the "MPV17" gene sorted by the number of times
    (frequency) the position has been observed.

        a) third column is "2", what does this condition mean?
        b) fourth column >= 27532360, what does this condition mean?
        c) fourth column <= 27548547, what does this condition mean?
        d) sixth column contains "N", what does this condition mean?
        e) sixth column does not contain "S", what does this condition mean?
        f) What are the top 6 most frequent positions listed out from the above command?
        g) Now let's have a look at the annotation or gtf file.
           Use the command given below lists transcripts for MPV17 along with 
           the exon start positions. Which transcripts contain all
           the exon start positions given out in step (f)?
           
            $ module load python3/3.9.0        
            $ python3 extract-exons.py



Part-4.1: Analysis in R
=======================
Use the following command to get into the R console
	  
	$ module load R
	$ R 


Part-4.2: Creating summarizedExperiment object
==============================================
To run this part, isssue the following command from the R console:

	> source("script.1.R")
    	   
   a) Describe what is done in this step.


Part-4.3: Log transformation
============================
To run this part, isssue the following command from the R console:
	
	> source("script.2.R")
	
   a) Describe what is done in this step.


Part-4.4: QC plots
==================
To run this part, isssue the following command from the R console:

	> library("pheatmap")
	> library("RColorBrewer")
	> sampleDists <- dist( t( assay(rld) ) )
	> sampleDistMatrix <- as.matrix( sampleDists )
	> colors <- colorRampPalette( rev(brewer.pal(9, "Blues")) )(255)
	> dev <- png(file="heatmap.png")
	> pheatmap(sampleDistMatrix, clustering_distance_rows=sampleDists, clustering_distance_cols=sampleDists, col=colors)
	> dev.off()
	> dev <- png(file="pca.png")
	> plotPCA(rld, intgroup =c("dex", "cell"))
	> dev.off()

The above steps should produce two image files ("heatmap.png" and "pca.png"). Use the
scp command to copy it from the server to your laptop (you need to do this from your laptop).
By looking at those images, answer the following questions.

   a) What is the closest pair of samples?
   b) What is the pair of samples with largest distance between?



Part-4.5: Interactive analysis
==============================
To run this part, isssue the following command from the R console:

	> source("script.3.R")
	> source("script.4.R")
	> source("script.5.R")

   a) Describe what is done in script.3.R
   b) Describe what is done in script.4.R
   c) Describe what is done in script.5.R


Part-4.6: Final script
======================
To run this part, isssue the following command from the R console:

        > source("script.6.R")

    a) Describe what is done in script.6.R
    b) What does adjusted p-value represent? Why do we need it - why donâ€™t we just use p-value?
    c) For the top 5 genes reported in your CSV output file "results.csv", look them up at 
       the ENSEMBL website and see if their differential expression under dex treatment 
       makes sense. For example, for ENSG00000162692 the URL you need to go to will be 
       http://useast.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?db=core;g=ENSG00000162692
