Follow these commands to install needed packages.

    $ module load python3/3.9.0 
    $ module load R
    $ R
    $ install.packages("cluster")
    $ install.packages("clusterSim")
    $ install.packages("ade4")


1) Visit the tutorial page for the entrotypes paper at
   https://enterotype.embl.de/enterotypes.html and read the "DATASETS" and
   "UNDERSTANDING THE GENUS ABUNDANCE TABLE" sections to answer the following 
   questions. The dataset is already downloaded and available at 
   /groups/bioc6243/data/csv/MetaHIT_SangerSamples.genus.txt

   a) How many columns does the dataset contain?
   b) How many rows does the dataset contain?
   c) What is given on the first column?
   d) What is given on the rest of the columns?
   e) What does the genus identifier "-1" represent in the second row?


2) Optimal cluster size
   From your private project-metagenomics folder run the command

   Rscript optimal-cluster-size.r 

   to output "sizes.png" plot file. In order to view this 
   image file, you will need to export it using "scp" (for mac) or 
   "wincp" (for windows). For example, if your laptop is map,
   you can do use the following command (from your laptop) to 
   scp "sizes.png" from cerberus to your laptop:
  
   scp $username@cerberus.arc.gwu.edu:~/mybioc6243/project-metagenomics/sizes.png ~/Downloads/

   
    a) What is the optimal number of clusters the dataset can 
       be clustered into?


3) Clustering using bet and pca analysis 
   From your private project-metagenomics folder run the command
        
   Rscript clustering.r
           
   to output "bet.png" and "pca.png" plot files. In order to view this
   image file, you will need to export it using "scp" (for mac) or
   "wincp" (for windows).

    a) Compare your output "bet.png" with Fiture 2a in the nature paper
       (Arumugam, Raes et al. 2011). Does it look the same aside the 
       labeling of the samples? You can refer to the mapping of sample IDs to 
       cluster IDs given in the csv file /groups/bioc6243/data/csv/entrotypes.csv

    b) Run the following command to list variance of each genus in a given 
       cluster (identified by 1,2, and 3). For example the command

       python3 dump-cluster-abandance.py -c 1 

       will list genera ordered by their variance in cluster 1.

       Run the above command for clusters 1, 2 and 3, and report
       the most variable genus for each cluster.
