Introduction
========================================================
    - Deadline for the project is Dec 11 11:59PM and last chance 
      to ask any question about the project is Dec 4 11:59PM.


1) Dataset used

    Example spectral dataset was downloaded from 
    https://regis-web.systemsbiology.net/PublicDatasets/, and the target database was 
    downloaded from: https://regis-web.systemsbiology.net/PublicDatasets/database/. 
    Please read https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2577160/ to learn 
    more on these datasets.


    From the pubmed article (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2577160/) and 
    spectral dataset download page (https://regis-web.systemsbiology.net/PublicDatasets/),
    answer the following questions:

        a) How many proteins are in the protein mixiture sample?
        b) What are the list of organisms these proteins correspend to?
        c) What instrument was used to generate Mix_7_ORBITRAP_mzXML.tar.gz?
        d) In what spectral file format is Mix_7_ORBITRAP_mzXML.tar.gz given?
        e) What is the file size for Mix_7_ORBITRAP_mzXML.tar.gz?

    Sources:
       Download Mix_7_ORBITRAP_mzXML.tar.gz from https://regis-web.systemsbiology.net/PublicDatasets/18_Mix/Mix_7/ORBITRAP/Mix_7_ORBITRAP_mzXML.tar.gz)
       Read top part of the file: /groups/bioc6243/data/msgfplus/OR20070924_S_mix7_11.mzXML 



2) Running MSGF+

   Use the command "sh run-msgfplus.sh" to run MSGF+ and locate your output files 
   under /groups/bioc6243/data/tmp/ 

        a) How many lines does your "mzid" output file have?
        b) How many lines does your "tsv" output file have? How many columns does 
           your tsv file have? List the columns/fields.
        c) In your tsv file, locate the row that has the lowest Qvalue. Which scan/spectra
           does this row belong to? Which protein? Which peptide?
        d) How many distinct proteins were identified?
        e) Which proteins that you expect to be in the sample (from the pubmed article) are 
           mising in your output?
